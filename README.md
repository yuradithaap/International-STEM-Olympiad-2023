<h2>Objective</h2>
Evaluate participant performance metrics from the International STEM Olympiad competition using Tableau and identify key trends and areas for improvement to enhance participant performance in future competitions.

<h2>Analytics Questions</h2>
Before we begin, let's first recognise some of the business questions we want to get from the data:

1. How many participants took part in the competition?
2. How many participants won ranking medals (Silver, Bronze)?
3. What material do participants find difficult?
4. Is there a relationship between the level and the wins achieved by the participants?

<h2>Analysis Results</h2>

1. In this competition, there were 18 participants divided into 14 participants from elementary school level, 3 participants from junior high school level, and 1 participant from high school level.
2. The elementary school level won the most medals, with 6 Silver medals and 2 Bronze medals. Meanwhile, the junior high school level won 2 Bronze medals.
3. Participants from elementary school level experienced difficulties with Array material, participants from junior high school level experienced difficulties with Repetition material, while participants from senior high school level experienced difficulties with Database material.
4. The higher the level of education, the harder the challenges faced and the more participants competing. It is estimated that the level of competition at the elementary school level is not as tight as at the junior high and high school levels, due to the lower number of participants and the lower level of difficulty.

<h2>Recommendation</h2>

1. Given the smaller number of participants at the junior high and senior high school levels, it can be considered to increase the number of participants at the junior high and senior high school levels. This can be done by expanding the promotion of the competition in more schools.
2. To improve performance in the next competition, it is recommended to provide more in-depth training on more difficult materials for each level of education.
3. Given the lower winning rate in junior high and high school, intensive training is expected to be carried out so that participants are better prepared to face the challenges.
